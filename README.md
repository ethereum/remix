## <a name="what-is-remix"></a>What is Remix?

**Remix** is a suite of tools to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in order to debug transactions, stored in this Git repository. A Remix transaction Web debugger is available [here](http://remix.ethereum.org), and its source code is part of this repository.

The **Remix IDE** is an IDE for Solidity dApp developers, powered by Remix. The Remix IDE repository **is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide)**, and an online version is available at https://remix.ethereum.org.

For more, check out the [Remix documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## <a name="how-to-use"></a>How to use Remix

### Prerequisites

To use Remix tools, you'll need to connect to an Ethereum node. You can do that using [the Mist browser](https://github.com/ethereum/mist), or by connecting to your local Ethereum node (`geth`, or `eth`). *Note: connecting to `geth` does not work through https.*

+ Using `geth`: `geth --rpc --rpcapi 'web3,eth,debug' --rpcport 8545 --rpccorsdomain '*'`.

+ Using `eth`: `eth -j --rpccorsdomain '*'`

**DO NOT DO EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS IF `geth`/`eth` STORES YOUR PRIVATE KEYS**, as any external system might be able to access your node's RPC server!

Those commands will run the RPC server on `localhost:8545`, which is the default URL that Remix will connect to. This instance should **only** be used for debugging purposes. Never use features that could have an impact on your keys: do not unlock any keys, do not use this instance together with the wallet, do not activate the admin `web3` API.

### Run the debugger

See [here](remix-debugger/README.md) how to install, run and use the debugger locally.

The debugger itself contains several controls that allow stepping over the trace and seeing the current state of a selected step.

## <a name="modules"></a>Remix Modules

Remix is built out of several different modules:

+ [`remix-analyzer`](remix-analyzer/README.md)
+ [`remix-solidity`](remix-solidity/README.md) provides Solidity analysis and decoding functions.
+ [`remix-lib`](remix-lib/README.md)
+ [`remix-debug`](remix-debug/README.md) allo debuggin transaction.
+ [`remix-tests`](remix-tests/README.md) provides unit testing for solidity.
+ [`remixd`](https://github.com/ethereum/remixd/tree/master) CLI which allow accessing local element from Remix IDE (see https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_remixd_filesystem.html)

Each generally has their own npm package and test suite, as well as basic documentation.
